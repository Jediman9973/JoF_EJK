Installation:
Unzip this file directly into your Gamedata folder, replacing any conflicting files.

If you had EternalJK previously installed, you'll want to go inside GameData/EternalJK and delete the japro-win-x86.pk3 file. It is being replaced by the jofclient-win-x86.pk3.


Changelog:
- Fixes the laggy npc's back to original standard.
